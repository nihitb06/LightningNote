# Lightning Note

Lightning Note aims to be a *lightweight* but still *powerful*, *open-source* note making (notepad) application.


The primary purpose of this application was to be a different sort of Notepad, one that *comes to the user*. So the user just has to **shake the phone twice** and the app will open itself.
The App also aims to implement a *Floating Note Helper* for phones without the accelerometer installed for detecting shaking action.
